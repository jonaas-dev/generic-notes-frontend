Here are the major architectures (in chronological order of popular use):

- Multi-Page Apps (MPAs)
- Progressively Enhanced Multi-Page Apps (PEMPAs, aka “JavaScript Sprinkles”)
- Single Page Apps (SPAs)
- The next transition

As we cover each architecture, we’ll consider specifically the following use cases of code:

- Persistence - saving and reading data from a database
- Routing - directing traffic based on the URL
- Data fetching - retrieving data from persistence
- Data mutation - changing data in persistence
- Rendering logic - displaying data to the user
- UI Feedback - responding to user interaction
